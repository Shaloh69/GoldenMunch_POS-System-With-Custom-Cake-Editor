# Touch Calibration Fix - January 2026

## Problem Statement
Touch calibration was not persisting reliably due to timing issues in the startup sequence. The calibration was being reset by display events and Chromium initialization.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Insufficient Settling Time
- **Original**: 10 seconds wait after Chromium launch
- **Issue**: Not enough time for all display events and Chromium initialization to settle
- **Impact**: Calibration could be reset immediately after application

### 2. Single-Apply Strategy
- **Original**: Calibration applied only once
- **Issue**: No verification or retry if the matrix didn't stick
- **Impact**: Fragile - one failure meant no calibration

### 3. Monitor Startup Delay
- **Original**: 5-second delay before monitor starts checking
- **Issue**: Gap between initial calibration and monitor protection
- **Impact**: Window where calibration could revert uncaught

### 4. Display Rotation Timing
- **Original**: 2-second wait after xrandr rotation
- **Issue**: X server may not have fully processed rotation events
- **Impact**: Subsequent operations could trigger calibration reset

## Solutions Implemented

### ✅ Fix 1: Increased Chromium Settling Time
**File**: `start-kiosk.sh:216`
```bash
# Before
sleep 10

# After
sleep 15  # Increased to 15s to ensure Chromium and all display events have settled
```

### ✅ Fix 2: Double-Apply with Verification
**File**: `start-kiosk.sh:229-266`
```bash
# FIRST APPLICATION (line 229-244)
- Map touchscreen to display
- Apply calibration matrix
- Log success/failure

# SECOND APPLICATION (line 246-266)
- Wait 2 seconds
- Re-map to display
- Re-apply calibration matrix
- VERIFY the matrix actually stuck
- Log the verified matrix value
```

### ✅ Fix 3: Reduced Monitor Initial Delay
**File**: `start-kiosk.sh:301`
```bash
# Before
sleep 5

# After
sleep 1  # Minimal delay - protection starts almost immediately
```

### ✅ Fix 4: Final Safety Calibration
**File**: `start-kiosk.sh:349-373`
```bash
# NEW: Apply calibration one final time AFTER monitor starts
# This ensures calibration is the absolute LAST thing applied
- Wait 2 seconds
- Re-detect touchscreen
- Map to display
- Apply calibration
- Verify and log final matrix
```

### ✅ Fix 5: Extended Display Rotation Wait
**File**: `start-kiosk.sh:118`
```bash
# Before
sleep 2

# After
sleep 3  # Increased to 3s to prevent calibration reset issues
```

## New Startup Timeline

## Benefits

### 🎯 Reliability
- **3 calibration applications** ensure it sticks (first, second, final)
- **2 verification checks** confirm matrix is correct
- **Extended settling times** prevent race conditions

### 🛡️ Protection
- **Faster monitor startup** (1s vs 5s) - minimal gap in protection
- **Final safety calibration** - absolute last application before kiosk runs
- **Continuous monitoring** - 45-second force-apply maintains calibration

### 📊 Visibility
- **Enhanced logging** shows all calibration attempts
- **Matrix verification** confirms what was actually applied
- **Timestamp tracking** helps debug timing issues

## Testing Recommendations

### On Raspberry Pi with Touch Display:

1. **Clean Boot Test**
   ```bash
   sudo reboot
   # After reboot, check logs:
   tail -f ~/.goldenmunch-logs/startup.log
   tail -f ~/.goldenmunch-logs/touch-calibration-monitor.log
   ```

2. **Verify Calibration Persists**
   ```bash
   # Check current matrix
   xinput list-props <TOUCH_ID> | grep "Coordinate Transformation Matrix"
   # Should show: -1.000000, 0.000000, 1.000000, 0.000000, -1.000000, 1.000000, 0.000000, 0.000000, 1.000000
   ```

3. **Test Touch Accuracy**
   - Tap all four corners of the screen
   - Tap should register exactly where you touch
   - No inverted or offset behavior

4. **Monitor Logs**
   ```bash
   # Watch for force-apply messages every 45 seconds
   tail -f ~/.goldenmunch-logs/touch-calibration-monitor.log
   ```

## Rollback Instructions

If issues occur, revert to previous version:
```bash
cd ~/GoldenMunch_POS-System-With-Custom-Cake-Editor
git checkout HEAD~1 client/Kiosk_Electron/scripts/start-kiosk.sh
sudo systemctl restart goldenmunch-kiosk
```

## Additional Notes

### X11 Persistent Configuration
The file `/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/99-touchscreen-calibration.conf` should also be installed for X-server level persistence:

```bash
cd ~/GoldenMunch_POS-System-With-Custom-Cake-Editor/client/Kiosk_Electron/scripts
bash install-touch-calibration.sh
```

This provides an additional layer of protection at the X server level.

## Change Summary

| Component | Old Value | New Value | Reason |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Chromium wait | 10s | 15s | More settling time |
| Calibration applies | 1x | 3x (first, second, final) | Ensure it sticks |
| Monitor delay | 5s | 1s | Faster protection |
| Display rotation wait | 2s | 3s | X server settling |
| Verification | None | 2x checks | Confirm matrix |
| **Calibration Matrix** | **Matrix 6** (`-1 0 1 0 -1 1 0 0 1`) | **Matrix 5** (`0 -1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1`) | **Correct for 90° CW rotation** |

## Matrix Update (Critical Fix)

**Date**: 2026-01-05
**Issue**: Matrix 6 was being applied correctly but produced inverted Y-axis behavior (swipe down = goes up)
**Solution**: Changed to Matrix 5 which swaps X,Y coordinates and inverts X axis - correct for 90° clockwise display rotation

**Matrix 5 Values**: `0 -1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1`
- Swaps X and Y coordinates
- Inverts X axis
- Perfect for ILITEK touchscreen with 90° clockwise (right) display rotation
